# Dallas County Residential Home Values Analysis

## Analysis Summary
From a local perspective, the mean home price in Dallas County increased during the five-year span covering the beginning of 2016 through the end of 2019.  The mean home value for all 29 cities within the county moved in a positive correlation with the county's home values.  The same can be said for the 16 independent school districts, although one was removed due to its sample size consisting of only 116 properties.

In terms of sales price, the least expensive homes, priced below or equal to $150k, performed the best in terms of total value appreciation.  Second in appreciation performance was the price range of $150k to $300k, which is where a majority of the first-time homebuyers' floorplans (typically 3 bedroom homes) are located.  Third and fourth in total home value appreciation were the affluent homebuyer price range ($300k to $600k) and the luxury homebuyer range (above $600k), respectively.  The affordable group ($0-$150k) particularly shined when the mortgage interest rates dipped in 2018, suggesting that an ease in financing obstacles supported an increased demand for affordable housing units.

When we included some national statistics for comparison, specifically the gross domestic product, unemployment, and the S&P 500, we found a positive correlation between the Dallas County residential home prices and the gross domestic product, and a negative, or inverse relationship, with unemployment.  The unemployment relationship with the Dallas County home prices would be the "truest" influencer, stating as unemployment goes down and jobs are plentiful, the home price in the county are stable or appreciate.  As for the S&P 500, there was no clear relationship established with the county home prices.  The S&P 500, considered a popular stock market benchmark, generally has trneded upwards over the past few years.  However, the confluence of serveral factors such as politics and international trade maneuverers, had a negative impact on the S&P 500 in 2018, resulting in an annualized loss of (4.31%).  Consequently, our current data suggests tha the S&P 500 and Dallas County home prices move independently of each other.

## County Home Value Influencers
Based on our data, the clear catalyst for home value performance is unemployment.  A second driver is home price range.  The homes priced below $150k are appreciating the quickest.  Movement in mortgage interest rates is not a catalyst for home values, but rather impacts the access to financing options.  As more financial products come online to serve a broader group of potential buyers, the ability to purchase available housing units increases, which can strengthen demand.

## Dallas County Home Value Projections
Our 3-year simulation is projecting a decrease in mortgage interest rates by 50 basis points.  As stated previously, better financing terms offered in an enviroment of low employment should indirectly increase demand for all housing.  The most significant impact of lower mortgage interest rates should be on the most affordable homes in the range up to $150k.  Consequently, those units should perform the best in terms of value stability or appreciation over the next three years.
